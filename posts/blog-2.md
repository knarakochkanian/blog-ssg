# Test Post

I am doing good today. This is a simple test post to demonstrate how text and images can be added to a blog post.

Here is an example of adding **bold** text, _italic_ text, and `inline code` for some basic Markdown formatting.

## Adding an Image

You can also include images in your blog post like this:

![Sample Image](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1317323736/photo/a-view-up-into-the-trees-direction-sky.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=i4HYO7xhao7CkGy7Zc_8XSNX_iqG0vAwNsrH1ERmw2Q=)

This is a sample image to showcase how you can display images in the content.

## More Content

Finally, you can add as much content as you'd like. Markdown supports lists, links, and much more:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
