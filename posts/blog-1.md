# Test Post

I am doing good today. This is a simple test post to demonstrate how text and images can be added to a blog post.

Here is an example of adding **bold** text, _italic_ text, and `inline code` for some basic Markdown formatting.

## Adding an Image

You can also include images in your blog post like this:

This is a sample image to showcase how you can display images in the content.

## More Content

Finally, you can add as much content as you'd like. Markdown supports lists, links, and much more:

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
